/*
 * oauth2.go
 *
 * This file provides an example OAuth2 authentication provider implementation.
 *
 * It should handle OAuth2 flows like authorization code grant, token exchange,
 * and token refresh with third-party identity providers such as Google, GitHub, or Facebook.
 *
 * Use this when your application needs to integrate with external login systems
 * or when acting as an OAuth2 client or resource server.
