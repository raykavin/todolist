/*
 * oidc.go
 *
 * This file defines an example OpenID Connect (OIDC) implementation.
 *
 * OIDC extends OAuth2 by providing ID tokens and standardized user information endpoints.
 *
 * It is useful for federated authentication scenarios, single sign-on (SSO),
 * and integrations with identity providers like Google, Azure AD, or Okta.
 *
 * The OIDC implementation should handle token verification, claims extraction,
 * and user profile mapping.
