package cache

/*
 * memory.go
 *
 * This file defines an in-memory cache implementation.
 *
 * Use this for lightweight, ephemeral caching that does not require external services.
 *
 * This is suitable for single-node applications, unit tests,
 * or features that only need short-lived local storage.
