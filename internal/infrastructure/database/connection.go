/*
 * connection.go
 * 
 * This file defines database connection setup and configuration.
 * 
 * It should handle opening connections, managing connection pools,
 * handling timeouts, and ensuring proper resource cleanup.
 * 
 * This abstraction helps your repositories connect to relational or NoSQL databases
 * while keeping the connection details isolated from business logic.
