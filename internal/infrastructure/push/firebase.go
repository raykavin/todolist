package notification

/*
 * firebase.go
 *
 * This file provides an example integration with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
 * for sending push notifications to mobile devices or web clients.
 *
 * Use this implementation to deliver real-time push messages, alerts, or updates
 * directly to user devices via Firebase.
 *
 * It can be used together with other push providers to support multiple channels
 * while keeping the notification logic consistent and decoupled from the business layer.
