/*
 * distributed.go
 *
 * This file defines a distributed cache implementation placeholder.
 *
 * Use this to integrate with distributed caching systems like Memcached, Hazelcast,
 * or other solutions for sharing cache data across multiple nodes or services.
 *
 * A distributed cache helps improve performance and scalability
 * by offloading frequent reads from the database.
